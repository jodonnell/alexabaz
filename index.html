                I am a licensed clinical social worker with specialized training working with children, adolescents and their parents. I am also adept at helping young adults deal with issues related to identity and intimacy- both dominant issues during this life stage.
                <p>
                  Starting therapy is an important and perhaps overwhelming decision. For parents, it is my role to help you and your child feel safe, understood and empowered to find solutions that strengthen your family. For individuals, I will help focus our work so you can realize your goals, whether they be linked to your career, relationships or identity issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through play therapy, traditional psychotherapy and parenting support and coaching I will encourage the expression of feelings and development of coping skills.

          I believe the first step to a productive therapy experience is creating a supportive and safe environment where people can begin to wonder about themselves and the important changes they would like to make. Through empathy, warmth and insight I have helped many people who feel ambivalent about the therapy process gain confidence, clarity and self-awareness.
          <p>
            I practice Interpersonal psychodynamic therapy which in simple terms means that I believe the relationship between client and therapist is an essential part of the process. The therapy room can be considered a microcosm of your outside world and naming and clarifying experiences and dynamics that occur between us can help foster the development of insight and helpful solutions. With my support and guidance these corrective experiences can heal old wounds and shift maladaptive thoughts and patterns to help you feel more balanced and fulfilled with your life.

        <h3>
          Adolescents
        </h3>
        Adolescents respond well to a flexible approach incorporating play and regular “talk therapy”.  Play can be a way to communicate anxiety and frustration as well as way to talk about their lives in a setting that feels less stilted. With the increased stress of academic standards, climbing social pressures and feelings of awkwardness that accompany puberty it is easy for adolescents to feel alone with their feelings. Not only will I provide your adolescent with a place to explore conflicted feelings and develop coping skills but I will help you be sensitive to their changing needs.
        <p>
          <h3>
            Teenagers
          </h3>
          It has never been easy to be a teenager – in limbo somewhere between depending on your parents and desperately wanting to be free of them. Many teens I work with feel  are struggling to form a cohesive sense of self because of the conflicting values they are encountering within their families or origin, peer groups and neighborhoods. It can be difficult for a teen to feel they can confide in their parents for a variety of reasons and sometimes a non-biased neutral adult feels safer. Ultimately, the goal is that your teen is able to  navigate their worlds feeling more empowered to ask for help when needed and take responsibility for their actions.

        <h3>
          Children
        </h3>
        Play is how children learn about and explore their worlds and in therapy it is often their main mode of communication.  Through play therapy I will help your child communicate his or her inner world so I can better assess what treatment goals to implement. I will help your child put words to his or her thoughts and feelings and help you manage your own emotions in order to be more attuned to your child. I believe regular parent sessions are helpful in my understanding of your child, the needs of your family and in developing the best set of interventions.
